To achieve good training results in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), you need a large dataset of images. This allows the model to learn effectively and produce accurate results.

Results I got for my model:
Training Accuracy:
[0.7217, 0.8750, 0.7543, 0.8125, 0.7661, 0.5000, 0.7706, 0.8125, 0.7850, 0.8125]

Validation Accuracy:
[0.8240, 1.0000, 0.8487, 1.0000, 0.8092, 1.0000, 0.8224, 0.0000, 0.8191, 1.0000]

You can also use a pre-trained model to improve results and reduce training time.
Thank you!
